Classes:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods the objects created from the class will have. In other words, a class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. A class itself is not a concrete entity but a concept that specifies how objects should be constructed and how they should behave.

Objects:
An object is an instance of a class. It is a specific, concrete entity with actual values for the attributes defined by its class and can perform the behaviors (methods) specified by the class. Objects represent real-world entities or concepts in a program, encapsulating state and behavior.

Conceptual Differences Between Classes and Objects
Blueprint vs. Instance:

Class: Acts as a blueprint or template. It defines the structure and behavior that the objects created from it will have but does not represent any specific instance.
Object: Is a specific instance of a class. It has actual values for the attributes defined by the class and can perform the methods specified by the class.
Definition vs. Realization:

Class: Defines what an object will look like and what it can do. It is an abstract concept that provides a definition.
Object: Realizes the class definition. It is a concrete entity that exists in memory with specific attribute values.
Memory Allocation:

Class: Does not allocate memory for data. It only defines the structure of the data.
Object: Allocates memory for the data defined by the class. Each object has its own memory space for its attributes.
Static vs. Dynamic:

Class: This is static in that it defines the attributes and methods once, and they do not change unless the class itself is modified.
Object: It is dynamic in that it can have different attribute values and change state over time through interactions with its methods.
Behavior Implementation:

Class: Contains the code for the methods that define the behavior. These methods specify what actions the objects can perform.
Object: Executes the methods defined by its class. When a process is called on an object, the object performs the action specified by the method.
