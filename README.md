# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

This project demonstrates the differences between arrays and ArrayLists in Java.

## Description

Arrays and ArrayLists are fundamental tools used to store and manipulate a set of elements. While they are closely related, they differ in usage and performance. This project showcases these differences through a simple Java program.

## Features

- **Fixed Size vs. Dynamic Size:** Arrays have a fixed size, whereas ArrayLists can dynamically resize.
- **Performance:** Arrays provide faster access by index due to fixed memory allocation, while ArrayLists have overhead due to dynamic resizing.
- **Data Types:** Arrays can store both primitives and objects, whereas ArrayLists can only store objects.
- **Functionality:** Arrays have limited built-in methods, while ArrayLists offer a rich set of methods for manipulation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists.git
